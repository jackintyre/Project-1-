**The code for generating the dataframe with PubPoints is SportsAPI-001. If you just want the data to process, you can read NewPubpoints_in_events.csv.

**There will be a separate api for generating the location data for the schools.  I have put the Scorecard csv file in this push, so you can see that the schools are accessible, see the MERGED..csv file.  I found it's better to use the csv file because using the API call causes denial of access once you reach 500 requests per day.

**The code for generating a listing of schools that are known with longitude and latitude is in SportsAPI-002.  The dataframe of location information is saved to Geo_df.csv.

**Events_master_df.csv - copy of dataframe that has all of the scheduling information and school locations as a cleaned data set.
